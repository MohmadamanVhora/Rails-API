# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# i = 0
# 50.times do |x|
#   i = i + 1
#   Article.create(title: "Title#{i}", body: "Body#{i}", release_date: DateTime.now)
# end

# 50.times do |x|
#   i = i + 1
#   Comment.create(comment: "comment#{i}", article_id: rand(1..50))
# end
